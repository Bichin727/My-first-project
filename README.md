This project utilizes vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas to generate random mazes with visual animations of the generation process. What makes it technically distinctive is the implementation of three fundamental pathfinding algorithms - BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and A* (A-Star) - with real-time performance metrics showing their distinct solving durations.
No external dependencies: Built purely with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, requiring no additional libraries.Single-file architecture: Consolidates maze generation logic, rendering systems, animation controls, and all three pathfinding algorithms in one self-contained file for transparent learning.Technical visualization: Color-coded elements distinguish walls, paths, start/end points, and algorithm-specific traversal patterns. Real-time timing displays highlight the performance differences between BFS (systematic but memory-intensive), DFS (memory-efficient but potentially longer paths), and A* (goal-directed with heuristic advantages).Interactive controls: Allow regeneration of mazes with adjustable dimensions, and side-by-side comparison of algorithmic solving processes to observe their characteristic behaviors
